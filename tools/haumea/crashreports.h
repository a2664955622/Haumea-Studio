// Crash and error reports. When Haumea crashes, a handler (POSIX signals;
// SetUnhandledExceptionFilter on Windows) writes what happened into a file
// opened at start, with only async-signal-safe calls; the next start turns
// it into <config>/reports/pending/<id>.json: the version, commit, channel,
// OS, graphics, the stack as module+offset, the last log lines and the mode
// and window, with the home folder, user name, game folder, workspace and
// map names replaced by placeholders. Errors the editor survives are
// reported the same way (CrashReportsError), a few per session.
// Sending asks first (a banner at the next start: View report, Send, Don't
// send, Always send; Preferences > Privacy: Ask, Always or Never), then POSTs
// JSON (at most 256 KB) to https://reports.itsneufox.xyz/haumea/reports; a 2xx
// deletes the report, and none is kept past 30 days. A report carries the
// install ID only while the daily ping is on. Never sent from tests, UI
// scripts, command-line modes, agent sessions or CI, nor with HAUMEA_NO_REPORTS;
// HAUMEA_REPORTS_URL points it at a test server (loopback may be http).
// The schema is tools/server/haumea_server.py's validate_report.

// At start, once the config folder is known: the handlers.

// After that: last run's crash becomes a pending report; old ones go;
// with Always they are sent. --crash-test (with HAUMEA_CRASH_TEST=1) crashes here.
